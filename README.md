# Javascript Stack

A simple personal implementation of a Stack Data Structure in Javascript.

## The stack class has the following methods:

##### 1. Push(element) - Adds an element on top of the stack.

##### 2. Pop - Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.

##### 3. Peek - Returns the element on top of the stack and logs it to the console without removing it.

##### 4. Contains(element) - Checks if an element is present in the stack, returns a boolean.

##### 5. Size - Returns the size of the stack.
